# Head tag

Inside the head tag, we have the meta tag, one meta contains charset set to “UTF-8”, which means almost all human readable characters can be used.  The meta tag can also be used to add other information such as name of the author, description of the page etc.

Eg. <meta name=”author” content=”Chris Mills”/>
<meta name=”desription” content=”This page is about cooking”/>

This meta information will be displayed while our page is searched on google search.

TIP:  specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines ( such activities are termed search engine optimization, or seo ).

 There are also other type’s of meta data.  For more information do research on this topic in MDN site.

To add icon’s to your site, use the link tag as follows

<link rel=”icon” href=”favicon.ic” type=”image/x-icon”/> // even if we want, we can add the sizes attribute too like sizes=”42x42”;

**ALWAYS UNDERLINE TEXTS ONLY FOR LINK’S.  IT IS ONLY APPROPRIATE.**

Underlining texts other than links is not a good practice.

## Headers tag ( h1-h6 )f
It is really good to use appropriate headers for displaying heading.
For eg. h1 for main heading, h2 for sub heading, h3 for sub-sub heading and so on.

Always need to follow proper semantics while developing sites. It is really important that you follow the right html semantic elements.
